My name is Pavel, I am currently living in Texas and I am an aspiring software developer. I like to explore various technologies, frameworks, programming languages, and lately I've been focusing on web development. I've used most mainstream languages minus the dot NET ecosystem. I feel most comfortable with Java and Ruby because these are the languages I've spent more time with. I am currently focusing on Ruby and Javascript because of Rails for the back-end and growing popularirty of JS frameworks for the front-end. I also started reading about LISP and Clojure which blows my mind and this blog is generated with Cryogen which was written in Clojure. Besides the tech I like to read and study history, literature, eastern philosophy. This is my blog where I am going to be posting my projects and ideas.
